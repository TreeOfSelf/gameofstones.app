		<h1>Variable, Functions, and Loops</h1>
		<p>The bread and butter of any programming langauge.</p>
		</br>
		</br>
		
		<div class="infoDiag">
		<p>It is very important moving forward that we understand these concepts before we start programming more complex applications in Node.JS</p>
		<p>I have created some really simple visuals to help you get more intuition regarding them.</p>
		</div>
		
		</br>
		</br>
		</br>
		<h1> Variables: </h1>

		<div class="infoDiag">
		<p>We should not consider variables as simply just numbers and strings, for example:</p>
		</div>
		</br>
		
		</br>
		</center>
		<textArea id="functionExample"></textArea>
		<script>
var funcExamp = CodeMirror.fromTextArea(functionExample, {
lineNumbers: true,
theme : 'panda-syntax',
});
funcExamp.setValue(`
sayHello = function(){
	console.log("Hello there!");
}`);
		</script>
		</br>
		<center>
		<div class="infoDiag">
		<p>You might not consider sayHello to be a variable, however, in javascript anything that has a set value, whether it be</p>
		<p>objects, arrays, functions, buffers, any sort of data</p>
		<p>It is still considered to be a variable and can use different variable keywords</p>
		<p>Examples of variable keywords:</p>
		</div>
		</br>
		</center>
		</br>
		<textArea id="keywordExample"></textArea>
		<script>
var keywordExamp = CodeMirror.fromTextArea(keywordExample, {
lineNumbers: true,
theme : 'panda-syntax',
});
keywordExamp.setValue(`
//Constants, they cannot be changed ever! 
//It is good practice to use these when requiring modules, 
//setting values that WILL never change (Like an encryption key)
const immutable = [1,2,3];

//Var keyword, without this the variable becomes global, lets look at an example
testFunc = function(){
	var test = "hello";
}
console.log(test);
//This would print undefined, because of the use of var. The variable is local to that function (like a parameter would be)

testFunc = function(){
	test = "hello";
}
console.log(test);
//In this example it WOULD print hello, because we did not use the var keyword, so it is now in the global scope.
//There is another keyword let, that is like var but even STRICTER in scope. For now lets just worry about var, const, and global variables.
//It is a good practice to use the most appropriote type of variable in a given situation.
//Take a peek at this example:

health = 100;
modifyHealth = function(){
	healthModifier = 0.5;
	health*=healthModifier;
}

//Because we did not use a var keyword for healthModifier, that variable now exists in the global scope, and therefore will use memory 
//and never go away. If w are only temporarily needing a variable then we should use var so that it will free that memory once it is 
//done using it.
`);

	<h1> Functions: </h1>
	</br>
	<div class="infoDiag">
	<p>There is a big difference in parameter variables and global variables</p>
	<p>Remember, parameter variables only exist in that function, stricly within the code block</p>
	</div>	
	</br>
	</br>
	
	<img src="img/parameterExample.png"></img>
	</br>
	
	<div class="infoDiag">
	<p>Think about it like this:</p>
	<p>The parameter is just a temporary reference the function will use for the actual value we pass to it.</p>
	<p>Once the function is done with it, it tosses the reference into the void forever.</p>
	</div>

	<h1> The Return Statement: </h1>
	</br>
	<div class="infoDiag"><p>You might remember seeing the return statement, if you don't remember this is how it works</p></div>	
	</br>
	</br>
	</center>
		<textArea id="returnExample"></textArea>
		<script>
var keywordExamp = CodeMirror.fromTextArea(returnExample, {
lineNumbers: true,
theme : 'panda-syntax',
});
keywordExamp.setValue(`

//Write your function like normal
addFive = function(numberInput){
	//Instead of changing a global variable, we take the parameter and effect it in some way and then use the return statement to spit it back out after we modify it
	return numberInput+=5;
}

//Then we can call our function , it returns a variable. So we can basically see our function as like a variable itself, that takes a parameter
sevenPlusFive = addFive(7);

//You can also do tricky shit like this

sevenPlusFivePlusFive = addFive(addFive(7));

//This "nesting" of functions is pretty weird to wrap your head around at first, but in time it will feel more natural to you. I remember you saying you prefer it to be written like this:

sevenPlusFive = addFive(7);

sevenplusFivePlusFive = addFive(sevenPlusFive);

//You what whatever makes you feel comfortable ,but just know that a lot of people will squish things together where they feel appropriote so be prepared.


`);
	</script>
	</br>
	<center>
	<div class="infoDiag"><p>It is also good to know you can write your return statement in a couple different ways just like how you can write functions in a couple different ways (but they do the same thing)</p></div>	
	
	</center>
	<textArea id="returnExampleTwo"></textArea>
	<script>
var keywordExamp = CodeMirror.fromTextArea(returnExampleTwo, {
lineNumbers: true,
theme : 'panda-syntax',

keywordExamp.setValue(`

function addFive(input){
	return input+5;
}

//Or we can write it as 

addFive = function(input){
	return (input+5);
}

//I typically always do my return statements with parentheses.
//As for how you define a function, either way works! I promise I am not trying to confuse you showing you all the different ways to do things 
//I just want you to be prepared for working with different types of styles.

`);

	<center>
	<h1> Loops </h1>
	
	<div class="infoDiag"><p>There are two main types of loops in javascript, a for and a while loop. They are key to making a program. I will try my best to explain them both</p></div>	
	</br>
	</br>
	<h1> The For Loop </h1>
	<div class="infoDiag"><p>So imagine, we have an array of numbers, and we want to write a function that adds 5 to each element of that array. Only issue is, we don't know how long it is</p>
	<p> Well, the way you do that is using a foor loop!</p>
	</div>
	
	</center>
	<textArea id="forLoop"></textArea>
	<script>
var keywordExamp = CodeMirror.fromTextArea(forLoop, {
lineNumbers: true,
theme : 'panda-syntax',
});
keywordExamp.setValue(`

//Index        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
numberArray = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];

//We reference indexes like this:
numberArray[5] // This would be equal to 6. A little confusing, because arrays always start at index 0! 

//Every array has a property associated to it (arrays are technically objects in javascript)
//It is called length and accessed like this:

numberArray.length // This would return 10 since there are 10 elements to our array

//Now how do we use this in a for loop?

       //SEMICOLON                    //SEMICOLON
for(k = 0;        k  <  numberArray.length;      k++){
	console.log(k);

}

// The result of running this would be:
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
// 6
// 7
// 8
// 9
	
//Now lets break down each part 

for()

//This is the outline for a for loop, we type for and then put parentheses and then on the inside we fill in how our loop will work

k = 0;

//Image k is like a parameter in a function, its a variable that references where we are in our loop, you don't have to use k, people typically 
//use a single character but you can also call it index, or anything. Then inside of our for loop, we use the variable k as our index like this:

numberArray[k] 

//The next part is our condition for when to stop the loop

k < numberArray.length;

//Essentially, the loop will keep running while this is true , so while k is LESS than the length of our array, keep running the foor loop 

k++

//This is how much we increment our k variable by each time the loop runs. k++ is the same as writing k+=1, as k-- is the same as k-=1

//Now REMEMBER there are semicolons at the end of each part (except for the last) that is how it knows to properly format our loop 

//So, lets see how we would write a for loop to add 5 to every index of our array 

for(k = 0; k<numberArray.length; k++){
	numberArray[k]+=5;
	console.log(numberArray[k]);
}

//Result:
//5
//6
//7
//8
//9
//10
//11
//12
//13
//14
//15 
 

}`);
	</script>
	<center>
	<h1> The while loop </h1>
	<div class="infoDiag"><p>A while loop is like a foor loop, the only difference is it is ONLY  the condition part, lets rewrite our above for loop, but only using a while loop </p></div>		
	</center>
	<textArea id="forLoopTwo"></textArea>
	<script>
var keywordExamp = CodeMirror.fromTextArea(forLoopTwo, {
lineNumbers: true,
theme : 'panda-syntax',
});
keywordExamp.setValue(`
numberArray = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
k =0;
while(k<numberArray.length){
	numberArray[k]+=5;
	console.log(numberArray[k]);
	k+=1;
}
	
//Result:
//5
//6
//7
//8
//9
//10
//11
//12
//13
//14
//15 

//So basically, the while loop is used when you want to keep doing something OVER and OVER until a condition is met, the foor loop is used when you specficially want to numerically iterate but the while loop can 
//be used in other ways like this:

while(enemyHealth>0){
	//COMBAT STUFF 
}

while(userConnected){
	//SERVER STUFF
}

//The for loop is more like going through an array 
//Theres another loop for looping through object properties, but I will save that for our objects lesson =)

	<h1> Putting it all together </h1>
	</br>
	
	<div class="infoDiag"><p>
	Assignment #1:</p>
	<p>
	You are given a number array with numbers 1-10. You must write a function that takes two parameters. The first parameter is the amount to add to each index, and the second is the amount to skip through the array by. </p>
	<p>So for example if we wanted to add 4 to every SECOND number of the array our parameters would be </p>
	<p>4,2 </p>
	<p>And the result would be:</p>
	
	<p>1,   2,   3,   4,   5,   6,   7,   8,   9,   10</p>
	<p>1,   <b>2+4</b>,   3,   <b>4+4</b>,   5,   <b>6+4</b>,   7,   <b>8+4</b>,   9,   <b>10+4</b></p>
	<p> EQUALS: </p>
	<p>1,   6,   3,   8,   5,  10,   7,   12,  9,   14</p>
	</br>
